# Portfolio Optimization Project

This is a personal pet project I'm working on to improve my coding skills and build up my CV. It‚Äôs a sandbox for me to experiment, learn, and hopefully create something useful (or at least interesting).

## üéØ What This Program Is For

The goal is to build a portfolio optimization tool using a variety of strategies, including:

1. **Sharpe Ratio optimization**
2. **Trend following & sentiment analysis**
3. **Other experimental or research-backed strategies** (TBD as I dig deeper)

## üöß Current Status

Right now, this project is *completely inoperable*. Just code fragments, broken ideas, and unfinished thoughts. But that‚Äôs part of the plan.

Over time, I‚Äôll be refining it while sharpening both my programming, machine learning, and financial analysis skills. I genuinely do not enjoy financial engineering ‚Äî but unfortunately, it pays quite well. My bigger dream is to fund my actual passions: robotics, electronics, and building cool shit that makes me feel alive.

Feel free to fork, remix, or learn from this code however you want. Just don't bet your retirement fund on it.  Or bet your retirement fund on a computer algorithm, it's your life brah.
