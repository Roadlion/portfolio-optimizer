# Portfolio Optimization Project

This is a personal pet project I'm working on to improve my coding skills and build up my CV. It’s a sandbox for me to experiment, learn, and hopefully create something useful (or at least interesting).

## 🎯 What This Program Is For

The goal is to build a portfolio optimization tool using a variety of strategies, including:

1. **Sharpe Ratio optimization**
2. **Trend following & sentiment analysis**
3. **Other experimental or research-backed strategies** (TBD as I dig deeper)

## 🚧 Current Status

Right now, this project is *completely inoperable*. Just code fragments, broken ideas, and unfinished thoughts. But that’s part of the plan.

Over time, I’ll be refining it while sharpening both my programming and financial analysis skills. I don’t exactly love financial engineering — but hey, it pays the bills. My bigger dream is to fund my actual passions: robotics, electronics, and building cool shit that makes me feel alive.

## ⚠️ Use at Your Own Risk

This code is **not tested with real money**. If you use it and lose money, that's on you. No guarantees. No refunds. No promises.

## 🙃 The Real Motivation

I’ll be honest — part of the reason I’m doing this is because I want a GitHub page that looks more impressive than my ex’s and her new boyfriend’s. Petty? Maybe. Effective fuel? Absolutely.

I have an inferiority complex, but I’m turning it into a fire that drives me to build, learn, and outgrow who I used to be.

Feel free to fork, remix, or learn from this code however you want. Just don't bet your retirement fund on it.
